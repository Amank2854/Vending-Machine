(23.10.2021) We have uploaded the proposals for two selected topics, namely, Vending Machine and Random Number Generator.\
(26.10.2021) The first proposal on 'Vending Machine' was approved. So, the second proposal is discarded.\
(05.11.2021) The source file 'Main.v' is uploaded. In the code, the modules for the three different items are defined. All the modules have their inputs and outputs defined along with the number of states they would require. (The code is based on the Finite State Machine model).\
The relationship among the states needs to be defined. The testbench is to be uploaded.\
(08.11.2021) The code for the module named 'Item_Three' is completed in the source code.\
(08.11.2021) The code for the module named 'Item_Two' is completed in the source code.\
(08.11.2021) The code for the module named 'Item_One' is completed in the source code.\
The testbench is to be created and uploaded. Debugging to be done.\
(16.11.2021) The code for the module named 'Item_Four' and 'VendingMachine' is added in the souce code. Comments are added in the source code.\
(16.11.2021) The source code is complete.\
(16.11.2021) The complete source code for the Test Bench is uploaded.\
Report is to be submitted.\
(27.11.2021) The Report is uploaded.\
**The project is complete.**
